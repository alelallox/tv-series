# tv-series
This Python program serve to keep track of the TV series watched in a year and give her a vote. The program allows you to insert new TV series with their vote and remove them with the command "pop" or remove them totally with "pop tot". In addition, it allows you to save the complete list of TV series in a text file, sorted descendingly for voting, with the command "save". The text file path can be specified by the user. At the end of the program, the dictionary is saved to disk using the Pickle module, so whenever the program is reopened, it will resume the dictionary with information saved in previous sessions.
